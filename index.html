<p>Hey there! I'm super stoked to join the Web Design track at Startup Institute. I studied Environmental Sociology in college, and am kind of obsessed with sleek sustainable products. My first gig after Colgate was at a tech startup as a Client Success Manager. WeSpire successfully fulfilled my passion for sustainability, but, here, I deepened my affinity for practical, mission-driven design. I don't know what I'm getting myself into really, but I know I'm in good hands üôè</p>
